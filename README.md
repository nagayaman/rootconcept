# rootconcept
This repository contains the R code, data, and results shown in the manuscript under submission. Note that this repository does not contain data for commercial use. Instead, authors uploaded the data that have been processed for the analyses.

# Setup
Before running the code, you need to install the following package in R. This package allows you to automatically install and and make available the packages needed for the analysis in the manuscript. 
```
install.packages("pacman")
```

Note that the code may produce slightly different results from those shown in the manuscript, depending on the environment. For example, the author has conformed that the latest version of the Louvain method for community detection using igraph produces slightly different results. Authors use igraph 1.2.6 for the analysis in the manuscript.
